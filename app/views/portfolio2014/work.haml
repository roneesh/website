    %h2#propercss Proper CSS
    %h3 A Ruby on Rails Generator
    %p ProperCSS is a Ruby on Rails generator that organizes the CSS in a project. I'm a big fan of clean, semantic CSS (and HTML too!). Proper CSS ensures that each project begins on the right foot. It organizes code into three folders: Base, Components and Modules. In the Base folder, there is a CSS reset file and files to define layout/grid systems, typography and SASS variables, which are used sitewide. Components has files that define the style for items used site-wide such as forms, lists, buttons, tables, etc. Finally, Modules contains files that style large portions of code such as headers, footers and asides. Organizing code this way makes writing and maintaining CSS much easier. Please fork the project and use it in your own Rails applications!
